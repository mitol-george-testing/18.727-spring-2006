These notes are somewhat rough: they may contain some mistakes, so please use caution when reading them.

Some notes about Grassmannians. ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/week1))

Some notes about the construction of the Hilbert scheme. Included are some notes on G.I.T. and the construction of the moduli spaces. ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/const))

Some notes containing a brief survey of the cohomology of the moduli space of curves and the Harer-Zagier formula for the orbifold Euler characteristic. I added a few words outlining other work of Harer on the stability of the cohomology of the moduli space of curves. ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/homology))

Some notes describing the Picard group of the moduli space of curves. ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/picard))

Some notes about the Kodaira dimension of the moduli space of curves. ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/generaltype)) You should also read Chapter 5 and 6F of Harris, J., and I. Morrison. _Moduli of Curves_. New York, NY: Springer-Verlag, 1998, p. 366. ISBN: 0387984380. (U.S.)

Some notes on the Kontsevich moduli space of genus zero stable maps. ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/kontsevich))
